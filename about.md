# About Me

My name is Alp Eren Shahbazli. I was born on 20 March 2008 in Bilasuvar. I studied at School No. 249 until the 2nd grade, after which I continued my education at the Humanitarian School Lyceum, where I later graduated.

I scored 665 points in the State Exam Center and was admitted to ADA University, where I am currently majoring in Computer Engineering.

Beyond academics, I enjoy playing football, chess, guitar, and video games. I love creating video edits, and I have a strong interest in analyzing player statistics. I am also actively improving my skills in game development, as it combines creativity, problem-solving, and technology—fields I am passionate about.
